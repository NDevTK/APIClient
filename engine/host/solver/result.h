/* THE RESULT DOCUMENT — one structure, built in C, read once by the host.
 *
 * The host is a BRIDGE and not a layer: it does ONE JSON.parse of one `@RESULT <json>` line and relays the
 * object. It does not stitch surfaces together, because stitching is structure, and structure here is the
 * engine's — the same reason identity and dedup are. Two lines (`@RESULT` endpoints, `@SEC` sinks) would make
 * the host assemble a document from parts, and a host that assembles is a host that can assemble wrongly:
 * an XSS-only page carries verified @S PoCs and no endpoints, and getting that case right is a property of
 * one document, not of two lines that happen to arrive together.
 *
 * Only what the ENGINE knows is emitted. The host fills its own empties (source maps, proto field maps) and
 * defaults anything absent, so a field this engine cannot yet answer is LEFT OUT rather than emitted as a
 * zero that reads like an answer.
