/* THE DOCUMENT INTERFACE — Blink core/dom, the members that can be answered truthfully today.
 *
 * WHAT IS HERE splits the same way Location does. `URL`, `documentURI`, `domain` and `title` are facts about
 * the document this engine actually parsed, so they are CONCRETE and a bundle that routes on them gets the real
 * value. `cookie` and `referrer` are INPUT — a cookie jar this engine was not given and a referrer the visitor
 * arrived with — so they are concolic, example-free, and a branch on either FORKS. `document.cookie` in
 * particular is the source that carries a session into a request URL, and collapsing it to "" makes every
 * cookie-gated path unreachable.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE is the tree: querySelector, getElementById, createElement, body, head. They need the Element
 * interface, which does not exist yet, and the honest answer is ABSENCE. A querySelector that returns null for
 * an element the document HAS is a lie the page cannot detect and this engine would report a surface it never
 * reached; a ReferenceError names the component to write. The DOM is parsed and sitting in `dom` — this
 * component holds it precisely so Element can be grown against it. */
